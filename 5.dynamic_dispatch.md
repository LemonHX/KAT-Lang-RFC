# Dynamic Dispatch

## Status
proof of concept + draft

## Abstract
everything using static dispatch is very good from the performance point of view
but when it comes to dynasty, it does suffer.

---

## Virtual Table
**STATUS**: fixed

C does not support dynamic dispatch
so we can see the following code everywhere around the Linux kernel.
```c
struct InterfaceA{
    void*(*f)(int);
};

void* Implf(int a){
    return 0;
}

int main(){
    struct InterfaceA a;
    a.f = Implf;
}
```

as the result, we could see dynamic dispatch just bind the vtable and data together.

because the vtable is compiled and after compile time we could know all vtables so the pointer to vtable is a const pointer and the vtable of types are stored in the `.data` section.

because of a dynamic dispatched object we don't know the size of it, we could only know the size of its pointer/reference, what we could do is bind the vtable pointer to its reference.

## pure dynamic dispatch
**STATUS**: draft

> rust dyn trait


keep it simple we are only using raw pointer
```kat
const todyn {@t: type}: (ptr t) -> type 
todyn = (x){
    .{
        vtable: t.get_vtable(), // conststaticptr struct{...}
        ref: sized_cast x
    }
}

const dyn : (type) -> type
dyn = (t){
    struct {
        vtable : t,
        ref : usize
    }
}

f : (dyn Interface) -> whatever
g = (){
    a : i32 = 1
    ptra : stackptr i32 = a.to_ref()
    dyna : dyn Interface = todyn ptra
    f dyna
}
```

## compile-time known dynamic dispatch
**STATUS**: draft

> rust impl Trait

just adding a assume in precompile variable define.
