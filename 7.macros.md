# Macros

## Status
proof of concept + draft

## Abstract
we do need macros

---


## I hate hygienic macros
I have used rust for ages, and hygienic macro fault lots of features
and the majority of famous rust frameworks highly relies on procedure macros.

hygienic macro is easy to write but at some stage programming language still need to implement non-hygienic ones.

Julia also does have impure macros for some corner cases that we couldn't solve by using hygienic macros.

but C's String macro suck we agree that we need some mechanism to check errors, scoping, and type checking.
## how about compile-time execute with codegen
it does look good on one hand we could execute non-macro code in macro,
on the other hand it is pure as possible.

```
macro m1($var1: ast, $var2: ast, var3: const i32) {
    if var3 < 10 {
        var1
    }else{
        var2
    }
}
// syntax sugar that we need
f : (m1 [i32,u32,10],m1 i32 u32 10, m1 {i32,u32,10}) -> m1(i32,u32,10)
```

### code generation
```
macro m2(v:const i32){
    arr = ast.block
    for i = 0
        i < v
        i = i + 1
    {
        print "hello from the compile-time macro expansion"
        arr.!push quote{
            print "hello from compiled macro"
        }
    }
    arr.!push quote(unquote(v))
    arr
}
f = (){
    i = m1(10)
    assert(i == 10)
}
```
