# Move Semantics

## Status
proof of concept + draft

## Abstract
with move semantics, we could use fewer clones,
at the same time, we could make rfc3 works

---

## Move operator
**STATUS**: draft

`move` + value is a moving operator,

move operator on normal value without implementing `RAII` interface will mark
that value is dead in compile time.

on value implemented `RAII` interface will mark the variable is dead but without executing the drop method of the value, the drop method will be executed in the scope of where the variable moved to.

```kat
a = lock.acquire()
f (move a) // lock will drop in f
b = a // error cloning a moved variable
```

## Reuse operator
**STATUS**: draft

instead of moving causing `RAII` to drop at the end of the scope,
reuse would not cause a drop at the end of the scope the place to drop is the scope before passing in.

also, it may change the inner value of the variable.

```kat
!f = (x: mutexfence i32) -> mutexfence f32 {
    do {
        xx <- x
        x.!update ((xx + 1) as f32)
    }
}
g = (lock: mutex i32){
    a : mutexfense i32 = lock.acquire()
    b : mutexfense f32 = !f (reuse a) // same address of a and droped this scope
}
```
