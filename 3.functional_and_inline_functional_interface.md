# Functional but inline interface design

## Status
proof of concept + draft

## Abstract
functional programming language does look good
but it relies on clone and value.
a composable interface is important in development but cloning
is harmful to memory usage and performance.

---

## impure method
**STATUS**: draft

method starts with `!` means this method is impure,
it may edit the value inside the `Self` type.

```kat
interface
    {@Container: (type) -> type, @inner : type} 
Functor(Container inner){
    fmap {@out: type}: (Self, (inner) -> out) -> Container out
    // self is passed in with `reuse` operator
    !fmap {@out: type}: (Self, (inner) -> out) -> Container out
}
```
for example implementing `Functor` for `List t`
```kat
impl{@t: type} Functor for (List t){
    fmap = (self,f){
        .{
            head: f self.head
            tail: fmap self.tail f
        }
    }
    !fmap = (self,f){
        self.head.!update (sized_cast (f self.head))
        self.tail.!update (sized_cast (self.tail.fmap! f))
        casted : List out = sized_cast self
    }
}

f = (x: List i32){
    y : List f32 = x.!fmap (x){x as f32}
}
```
