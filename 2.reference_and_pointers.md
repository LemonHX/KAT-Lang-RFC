# Reference And Pointer

## Status
proof of concept + draft

## Abstract
we have the following reference types in common
- a reference to stack data(fix address)
- a reference to unmanaged heap data(fix address)
- a reference to const data(maybe no address because of optimization)
- a reference to managed heap data(unfixed address)


- a reference to RAII implemented structure
  - a reference to GC with barrier pined address(fix address in a short time)

our goal is to at least generalize the reference type
and with the ability to get full control and accessible as possible to inner data

## reference type and interface
**STATUS**: draft

show this type is a reference,
for every instance must implement

require `monadic` for make `do` block works

- lift to stack ptr: `&` operator in c/c++
- lift to stdglobalheap ptr: `(type*)malloc(sizeof(type))` in c
- lift to gc ref: `&` operator in golang

```
f = (){
    x = 1
    // TODO: lift method to stackptr is a hole method
    y : stackptr typeof(x) = x.lift()
}
```
equiv to c
```c
void* f(){
    int x = 1;
    int* y = &x;
    return y;
}
```
example 2
```kat
g = (x: heapptr i32){
    do{
        xx <- x
        x.!update xx + 1
    }
}
```
equiv to c
```c
int* g(int* x){
    *x = *x + 1;
    return x;
}
```
