# Packed Args

## Status
proof of concept + draft

## Abstract
we have used `template <class T...>` in C++, it is very useful in case that we need to match a function without knowing how many input types.

---

`__PARAMS__` is a hole in the matching system,
which is equal to a compile-time array of type,
but will match function parameters
```
f {args: __PARAMS__, C : args -> i32} : (C) -> ((args) -> i32)
f = (f){
    f
}
```
